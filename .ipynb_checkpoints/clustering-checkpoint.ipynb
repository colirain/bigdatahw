      "|204805|BP report into Gulf of Mexico disaster lays blame on other contractors\n",
      "\n",
      "BP released their report into the causes of the \"Deepwater Horizon\" disaster earlier this year on Wednesday, and shifted much of the blame for the explosion and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, onto , the company managing the rig. The report concludes by stating that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\" contributed to the accident which it says arose from \"a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces.\" The report, the product of a four-month investigation conducted by BP's Head of Safety Operations, Mark Bly, criticizes the oil rig's fire prevention systems, the crew of the rig for failing to realize and act upon evidence that oil was leaking from the surface of the ocean, and describes how BP and Transocean \"incorrectly accepted\" negative pressure test results. The document goes on to note that the blow-out preventer failed to operate, likely because critical components were not operational.\n",
      "\n",
      ", who will become chief executive of BP, described the accident as \"tragic\". He said, \"we have said from the beginning that the explosion on the \"Deepwater Horizon\" was a shared responsibility among many entities. This report makes that conclusion even clearer, presenting a detailed analysis of the facts and recommendations for improvement both for BP and the other parties involved. We have accepted all the recommendations and are examining how best to implement them across our drilling operations worldwide.\" The report included 25 recommendations, according to a press release, \"designed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident.\" The oil company has previously blamed Transocean and , the well contractor, for the disaster and BP executives feel they have been unfairly blamed by US politicians for the disaster, and the report continues this view.\n",
      "\n",
      ", who was fired from the position of BP's chief executive following multiple public relations issues, squarley places the blame for the disaster on Halliburton. \"To put it simply, there was a bad cement job,\" he said in a statement, also claiming that BP should not be the only company to take the blame for the explosion. \"It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident,\" he argues. The report blames the type of cement used by Halliburton, designed to prevent harmful hydrocarbons from reaching the seabed, as well as criticizing the crew of \"Deepwater Horizon\", for failing to realize for forty minutes that oil had started to leak from the well, and once it was realized, the crew \"vented\" the hydrocarbons \"directly onto the rig\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Describing how the explosion, which killed eleven rig personnel, occurred, the report states that \"the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms,\" where the hydrocarbons ignited and a fireball engulfed the rig. But, the report states, the blowout preventer, the ultimate failsafe on the \"Deepwater Horizon\" failed, likely due to the fire on the rig. An automated system was not operational because the batteries powering it, located in a control pod, had gone flat, and another control pod contained a faulty solenoid valve. \n",
      "\n",
      "The report was likely, however, written with the company's legal liability for the disaster in a prominent position, since they are facing hundreds of lawsuits and criminal charges as a result of the spill. The executive summary is four and a half pages long and the first page is made up entirely of legal disclaimers saying if BP was found to be negligent in their operations of the rig, they could be fined a good deal more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Questions have also been raised as to why BP has chosen to release their report before authorities examine the blowout preventer. The energy editor of \"\", Terry Macalister, wrote that the \"catalougue of errors - both human and mechanical\" in the report \"demolish\" the oil industry's \"much quoted mantra\" of safety first. \"It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced,\" he wrote. \"It is worth remembering that BP, its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector. If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do, then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry?\"\n",
      "Transocean described the report as a \"self-serving\" attempt to \"conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the incident: BP's fatally flawed well design. In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk – in some cases, severely.\" In a statement, the company listed five issues they felt had contributed to the disaster that were no fault but BP's. \"Transocean's investigation is ongoing, and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in, including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive.\" Members of Congress, who are also carrying out a review into the disaster, also dismissed the report. Ed Markey, the Massachusetts democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said that he felt the report was simply a lengthy defense of the oil company's handling of the spill. \"BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bly acknowledged during a press conference in Washington that the report did not detail the charges raised against the company in Congress and that BP permitted a culture of recklessness to flourish. He did, however, reject suggestions that cost-cutting had put lives at risk and the rig was a disaster waiting to happen. \"What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information,\" he said. \"The Guardian\" reported that \"the report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures. It is also closely focused on the rig itself. No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Associated Press reported that Bly \"said at a briefing in Washington that the internal report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame. The six-person investigating panel only had access to a few workers from other companies, and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released.\" The report continued, \"Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, said the report clearly shows the company is attempting to spread blame for the well disaster, foreshadowing what will be a likely legal effort to force Halliburton and Transocean, and perhaps others, to share costs such as paying claims and government penalties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Head of Greenpeace's energy campaign Jim Footner said that it was \"highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP.\" However, he said, \"the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy.\" Alfred R Sunsen, whose oyster company operating in the Gulf of Mexico is facing the prospect of going out of business after 134 years, reacted angrily the the report. \"The report does not address the people, businesses, animals, or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster,\" he said. The New York Times said that the report is \"unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the , which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill,\" and described it as \"a public relations exercise\" and a \"probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges, penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wayne Pennington, head of the geological engineering department at , also alleged that BP was wrong to blame other parties involved with the disaster. \"The blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job, allowing the omission of standard testing procedures, and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light.\" He continued: \"Instead, skepticism should reign on any drilling job, and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log, the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process. This was clearly not done, repeatedly, in the case of the Macondo well, and disaster resulted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dudley went on to say that BP \"deeply regret\" the disaster. \"We have sought throughout to step up to our responsibilities. We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations. We will invest whatever it takes to achieve that. It will be incumbent on everyone at BP to embrace and implement the changes necessary to ensure that a tragedy like this can never happen again.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) throughout Europe and the United States are currently assembling a flotilla of up to 20 ships, which will set sail for the Gaza strip in the coming months in an attempt break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory. Israeli-Swedish activist Dror Feiler said that the goal of the new flotilla is to double the size of the previous one, and for it to include more than a thousand people. \"The Israeli Army can stop 12 to 50 ships if it wants,\" Feiler said. \"[Nonetheless] there are so many ships since so many people want to get together to stop the siege, which is a collective punishment on the people of Gaza and is unacceptable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israel Defense Force is monitoring the actions of the planned flotilla, according to a report in the \"\" on Tuesday. The Israeli army is calling this new fleet of ships \"the mother of all flotillas.\" A wide range of scenarios is being prepared for which include the possibility that due to the larger number of ships reported to be part of the flotilla, the Israeli navy may need to intercept it before the ships get close to Israel's shoreline. Officials say that Israel will warn ship operators that their crew may be detained and the vessel held until impound fees are paid, claiming the backing of international maritime treaties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The legal approach proved effective as a deterrent, and we're prepared to see it through as a punishment. If we are to pay a price for defending the blockade, the other side will pay a price for challenging it,\" a senior Israeli government official. The official declined to be named.\n",
      "\n",
      "A European campaigner against the blockade, Anwar Ghabi, told Arabic news agency Quds Press that the new flotilla will be backed by hundreds of NGOs, including several human rights groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first flotilla to challenge the blockade was stopped by Israeli naval commandos in May this year. Nine activists were killed, and several dozen activists and seven Israeli commandos were wounded after Israeli troops clashed with activists. Harsh international and domestic criticism followed. Subsequent aid ships were seized or diverted to Egypt.\n",

      "Some of the eight tourist fatalities involved in a in the in August may have inadvertently been shot by police during a raid on the vehicle, authorities investigating the incident have said. Philippine justice secretary told that bullet trajectories and wounds received by the hostages indicate that some of the eight were killed by “friendly fire”. \n",
      "\n",
      "She did not confirm, however, that the wounds inflicted by police bullets were the ones which led to the deaths of the hostages. \"There is a big possibility that there [was] friendly fire,\" she said. \"We are not focusing on [the possibility], but we should never miss that. Otherwise our report will be less than thorough.\" Police have insisted that all the fatal wounds were inflicted by the hostage taker’s gun. They maintain that other bullets, fired at the bus by police snipers and an assault unit, did not lead to the deaths of the tourists.\n",

      "The incident occurred when a former Filipino policeman kept tourists from , , hostage by hijacking their bus in , the capital of the Philippines. Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists, before being gunned down and killed after an eleven-hour standoff with police.\n",

      "\"Our government is now focused on taking the necessary steps to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again,\" said Aquino during a live interview on national television. \"Let me just say that this incident will not define this administration.\" The report is expected to be released on September 15. \n",

      "De Lima, who is heading up the inquiry, added that forensic examinations on a number of the dead tourists did not match the statement made by the bus driver, who claimed that the gunman shot them at close range. \"What is crucial, occupying our minds, is if the shots were made at close range, [these] are not consistent with forensic findings,\" she said. De Lima states that the entry points of the wounds did not show burn marks that would have been caused by the muzzle of a gun being shot from close range. She added that it was possible that other units deployed around the bus may have fired on it. China criticized the rescue operation, stating that the Philippine police force who carried out the raid were poorly trained and under-equipped to handle the situation.\n",

      "Aquino says he makes himself personally responsible for the incident, which according to the has \"chilled ties with Hong Kong and damaged the Philippine tourism industry.\" He added that he intends to form an elite unit to engage in a similar incident, which would consist of 200 and 400 soldiers and police officers who are capable of responding to any threats or incidents that occur in the country.\n",

      "Mendoza was reportedly taking revenge for having been fired from the from the Police Force after claims of robbery and the use of drugs were made against him. His brother explained that \"his problem was he was unjustly removed from service. There was no due process, no hearing, no complaint.\" Both government officials and his brother had tried to negotiate with him to release the hostages.\n",

      "Shoya Tomizawa, a 19-year-old Japanese motorcycle racer from Chiba, has died after being involved in a crash at the Misano World Circuit during the San Marino Grand Prix. While on lap 12 of the race, Tomizawa fell in Turn 10, a fast right-hand corner called the Curvone, when he was forced wide and lost grip in his rear tyre. He was then hit by the motorbikes of both Alex de Angelis and Scott Redding. He was immediately attended to by the on-track medical staff and transported to a local hospital in Riccione where he later died.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentino Rossi, the MotoGP world champion, commented on Tomizawa's death. He said, \"I found out now, when things like this happen nothing else matters. He was a lovely guy, it was a horrible accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Paolo Giovagnoli, the prosecutor of the Province of Rimini (in which the Misano World Circuit is located), is reported to have launched an investigation into the death that could lead to criminal charges. The race was not stopped so that Tomizawa could be treated at the track. Instead, he was quickly carried from the track on a stretcher, which was dropped when he was being carried across some gravel.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Finnish communications corporation Nokia announced that its Head will change on September 21. The previous chief executive will continue to chair in non-executive capacity. The head of Microsoft Business division will take the position. It is the first time a non-Finn becomes Nokia president and chief executive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The change follows Nokia's fall in world markets. It includes a decrease in Nokia's American market share to less than ten percent after failed negotiations with a number of leading American phone providers. An analyst at a market analyst company Pete Cunningham said, \"Despite holding 38 percent market share of the smartphone market, Nokia’s failure to compete with the iPhone and high-tier Android devices, combined with its lack of progress in gaining significant traction in the United States, has led to press and investor dissatisfaction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commenters suggested that Nokia chose Mr. Elop partly because he is a Canadian, following criticism of American candidates by the Finnish press. However a Nokia spokesman rejected this, saying, \"Nationality was not a selection criteria.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen Elop was president and CEO of the graphics and web-development software house prior to its acquisition by Adobe in 2005. He then joined Microsoft as President of Microsoft's Business Division in January, 2008. Commenting on his new role he said, \"Nokia has a unique global position as well as a great brand upon which we can build. The Nokia slogan clearly states our key mission: \"Connecting People\", which will acquire new dimensions as we build our portfolio of products, solutions and services.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the announcement the Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors stressed an expected shift of focus from hardware to software. \"His <nowiki>[Stephen Elop's]</nowiki> strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company. We believe that Stephen will be able to drive both innovation and efficient execution of the company strategy in order to deliver increased value to our shareholders\".\n",

The Catholic Church has been preparing an official visit of Benedict XVI for some time, with the visit starting tomorrow. The initial plans were made last September; the visit was only announced on March 16, 2010 when it was officially confirmed by the Vatican. The tour extends through Sunday, and includes stops in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Birmingham, at the latter of which the Pope is going to celebrate the Beatification of .\n",

      "A further incident happened at the end of April 2010 when a British internal memo (attached to an official document which listed brainstormed ideas for the Pope's tour) suggested many sarcastic ideas for Benedict XVI. This included launching a condom brand marked \"Benedict\", or, during his visit in UK, inaugurating an abortion clinic, blessing a homosexual couple, or ordaining women as priests. The Ministry immediately apologized and explained that the document was only brainstorming that didn't represent the political positions of the Foreign Office. The Vatican answered via Benedict XVI's spokesman the Rev. who said \"[a]s far as the Vatican is concerned, the case is closed. There never was the slightest doubt about the trip.\"\n",

      "A recent story about police departments warning parents to beware of an Internet joke called \"Pedobear\" took a dark turn on Tuesday, when a Tulsa television station alerted the public that a \"registered sex offender\" was dressing up as the mascot, and handing out candy to children at family-friendly events. \"A registered sex offender was spotted dressed as a Japanese cartoon character called 'Pedobear',\" reported the FOX 23 news broadcast that evening. \"That happened in San Diego at a comics conference, at an event that attracts plenty of families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the report was incorrect, and the man escorted out of the San Diego Comic Con in July was not a registered sex offender at all. \"I did say it to the reporter,\" admitted Tulsa Police Sgt. John Adams. \"It was bad information, a miscommunication.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Adams added, \"We have the Tulsa State Fair coming up, and we wanted to let parents know about potential dangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This report gave credence to the rapidly-spreading story of the menacing Pedobear, a satirical cartoon bear that has come to represent paedophilia on the Internet. According to some law enforcement agencies, Pedobear is being used by paedophiles to indicate their sexual interests to one another. They also assert that paedophiles may be dressing up as cute mascots, as a way to get close to children.\n",

      "These assertions have been widely ridiculed on the Internet. The \" wrote, \"He isn't, in any way, a mascot or supporter for pedophilia.\" The Internet meme originated on the website , where it was used to mock overly sexualized images of children. Often, an image of Pedobear was added to the offending posting, with the message, \"Pedobear approves of this post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, the meme moved out onto the wider Internet, where it has been repeatedly used as a shorthand way of saying that people were being inappropriate about children. During the , Pedobear was often used to mock the church. A Polish newspaper mistakenly ran an image of Pedobear alongside the 2010 Vancouver Olympics mascots, much to the delight of Internet jokesters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police in California misunderstood the meaning of Pedobear, and the San Luis Obispo Sheriff's Department began warning parents in public information fliers that Pedobear was an indication of paedophiles nearby. The story has become an Internet-wide sensation over the past few days, as in-the-know bloggers and reporters began to mercilessly ridicule the police department's actions in the name of protecting children.\n",
