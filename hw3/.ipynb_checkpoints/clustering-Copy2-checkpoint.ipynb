      "The \"Deepwater Horizon\" is dead. Almost five months after an explosion rocked an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana and caused a natural disaster on a scale not seen before, BP yesterday announced that that the well has been completely shut off. Thad W. Allen, the former admiral who is heading up the response to the oil spill on behalf of the U.S. government said in a statement that the well now \"poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico.\" He also released a U.S. goverment department's confirmation of the news. \"The has confirmed that the cementing operation on the Macondo well was successful, that the well has been permanently sealed with cement plugs, and that pressure tests verify the integrity of the plugs,\" it read. BP released a statement, describing the sealing of the well as \"a significant technological accomplishment and another important milestone in our continued efforts to restore the Gulf Coast.\"\n",

      "Early on Sunday morning, those aboard \"Development Driller III\" drill rig, which aided in the shutting down of the well, successfully conducted a pressure test, and concluded that cement pumped through a relief well into the Macondo well was going to hold. The tests concluded that the cement finally put an end to an environmental disaster that has affected BP, the wildlife on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the hundreds of people who make their living by fishing in the area. Forrest Travirca, who lives in Louisiana, said he was very angry with the response by BP and the authorities. \"All the brown spots and patches you'll see on this beach for the next nine miles is oil, too... And if you dig down a few inches or a few feet, you'll see oil, too. And if you walk into that marsh back there, you'll find oil,\" he said. \"So don't tell me we dodged any bullets. Or that it wasn't so bad. 'Cause I've been out there every day since May dealing with all that oil we dodged. It just makes my blood boil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiral Allen admitted that the disaster was far from over. \"Although the well is now dead, we remain committed to continue aggressive efforts to clean up any additional oil we may see going forward,\" he said, adding that the response, lead by his team and BP \"has been driven by the best science and engineering available. We insisted that BP develop robust redundancy measures to ensure that each step was part of a deliberate plan, driven by science, minimizing risk to ensure we did not inflict additional harm in our efforts to kill the well. I commend the response personnel, both from the government and private sectors, for seeing this vital procedure through to the end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The spill began in April, when \"Deepwater Horizon\" exploded, killing eleven people, after the blowout preventer failed. Oil began to leak into the Gulf, soon developing into the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. 4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "BP released their internal review into the spill last week, but it was rebuffed by the head of Greenpeace's energy campaign, Jim Footner, who said that it was \"highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP.\" However, he said, \"the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy.\" The report concludes by stating that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\" contributed to the accident which it says arose from \"a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces.\" In their statement, BP said that they \"will continue sharing what we have learned in an effort to prevent a tragedy like this from ever being repeated. We also believe that the industry will gain important insights on how to be better prepared to respond to any future incidents.\"\n",

      "Researchers at the have found that a common cold virus may be linked to . \n",
      "\n",
      "In the study of 124 children aged eight to eighteen, kids who had antibodies to (AD36) weighed on average 50 pounds more than children who didn't have the antibodies. When children have AD36 antibodies, that means they had the virus at some point in their life. AD36 causes colds and eye infections. \n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing the obese children who had the antibodies versus the obese children who didn't have the antibodies, the kids with the antibodies were significantly more obese, at 35 pounds heavier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This shows that body weight regulation and the development of obesity are very complicated issues,\" Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, the study's lead author, said. Schwimmer also said that \"[i]t's not simply a case that some children eat too much and others don't. There are children who eat all the wrong things in all the wrong quantities who are not obese.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Schwimmer said that he's not blaming the US childhood obesity epidemic on the virus, but noted that \"I’ve seen children who had very brisk weight gain in a given year for reasons that were very hard to pinpoint. These may be the children who have obesity related to this infection.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The study is backed up by past reports that show the virus boosts production of fat cells. In studies in which animals were infected with AD36, the animals gained a significant amount of weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is currently no vaccine for AD36, and no routine screening for the virus. Dr. Goutham Rao, clinical director of the Weight Management and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that \"People want a magic solution. Unfortunately, we don't have one. What people can do is focus on a child's behaviors and eliminate the unhealthy behaviors.\" Rao also said that \"Instead of coming to the doctor and requesting a test for the virus, parents would do better to discuss key behaviors to combat obesity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. James Cherry, specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was also interested by the study. He said that if the link between AD36 and obesity were confirmed, developing a vaccine for the virus could be worthwhile. \"More than 20 percent of the obese children in this study were positive for the antibody. If we could prevent 20 percent of all obesity, that would be pretty impressive,\" Cherry said.\n",

      "A researcher at the University of Oxford has found a saucy poem attributed to , the 17th-century poet who wrote \"\" and other religious verse. \"An Extempore Upon a Faggot\", discovered in an 18th-century anthology of poetry, is not thought by modern scholars to be by Milton, however, and may in fact have been written by one of his rivals in an attempt to disgrace him.\n",

      "The poem was found by Dr Jennifer Batt, who said that it \"is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton.\" She discovered the rude verse in the Harding Collection of poetry anthologies held by the , the main university library at Oxford. \"To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least\", she added. \n",
      "\n",
      "The book in question, the \"Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany\" from 1708 (over 30 years after Milton's death), was described by another Oxford academic, Dr Abigail Williams, as \"a set of poems written by witty young men about town for witty young men about town\". Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.\n",

He followed it with \"\", depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness. \n",

      "Bawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem \"to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary.\" She suggests that the culprit might have been , a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.\n",

It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago. The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom. Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that \"[y]ou could become very rich and famous – well, famous, anyway – if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton.

      "\n",
      "Authorities have said that an anonymous phone call warning of a potential terrorist threat aboard an aircraft may have been a hoax call. Swedish police detained a passenger aboard a on suspicion of preparing an attack on the aircraft, but he was later released. A police spokesperson said: \"The man who was the suspect for the bomb case was released by the district attorney. They couldn't find any crime done, therefore [they] decided to release the man and he's free to go where he wants.\" A statement released by Swedish prosecutors confirmed that \"the prosecutor on duty decided not to keep the man suspected of having explosives on the airplane in detention. The suspicions against this man are not sufficiently solid to keep him in detention and so he is free to leave Sweden. No further information can be given for [the] moment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The jetliner, which was carrying 273 people according to an airport spokesperson, was flying Flight 782, which travels from to , when it was diverted to in after Canadian officials were informed that a passenger had explosives on his person. Passengers were reportedly informed that they had to divert for technical reasons, but were only told on the ground why they had to land in Stockholm. \"The pilot only informed us that he's landing there due to security reasons. All passengers and crew members are well,\" a spokesperson for the airport said. Upon landing, the aircraft was evacuated, and the suspect was arrested by a team. Passengers were taken away from the aircraft, which was encircled by armed police, by buses. 35-year-old Irfan Ahmed, a passenger on the flight said: \"We really got scared, especially when we saw a large number of commandos wearing masks coming in.\"\n",
      "A police spokesperson said that two calls were received from a payphone in Canada, but no were found on the man or in the aircraft, which was searched by a bomb squad. Police warned that the warnings may in fact have been made by a prank caller, but said they had to divert the aircraft because they take such threats \"very seriously.\" The man, according to police official Stephan Radman, was being questioned at a police station. Earlier, he said that police were \" searching the plane with bomb technicians to see if there is something we can find but so far we haven't found anything, neither on the plane nor on the man,\" he said. The flight crew and some passengers were also interviewed. They were later allowed back aboard the aircraft to continue their flight. The suspect was released several hours after being taken into custody, and reports suggest officials are helping him book a flight to continue his journey to Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radman stated that police had learnt of the threat from a Canadian woman, who allegedly made two calls to police from a after the plane had lifted off. \"The aircraft started in Toronto at 05:15 local time and when the aircraft was in Swedish territory, a woman called the Canadian police and said that this man could probably have a bomb on board the aircraft,\" said Janne Hedlund, a police official. \"She called through a payphone, so the Canadian authority don't really know who the woman is. The Canadian authority alerted the pilot and he landed in Arlanda airport. The aircraft is evacuated and the suspect is under control by the police authorities in . We are going to question him now.\" A police spokesperson said: “A woman called police from a pay phone in Canada and told Canadian police about the man. She said the man may have had explosives, but he passed security checks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, however, announced that the call may have been a \"terrorism hoax,\" and said it was investigating. According RCMP spokeswoman Sgt. Julie Gagnon, the tip-off was of “unknown reliability”, adding that if it was found that the tip-off was a hoax, the woman who made the call will likely be prosecuted under public mischief charges. \"There's an ongoing investigation related to the information to see whether it was deemed to be a hoax or not. If the person who passed on that information was mischievous, then they can be charged with public mischief,\" she said. Police later said that they were attempting to find out whether the anonymous woman had a grudge against the suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Canadian police spokesperson said that they had received two calls. \"The first call provided vague information,\" he said. \"It did lay out that there was an individual on that specific flight in possession of explosives and then the second call provided more details with regards to the identity of the person.\" He said that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police \"take any call of this nature very seriously,\" and said that the call may have been a hoax. \"We have to ascertain the credibility and reliability of the call and try to determine whether there was a deliberate intent on behalf of the caller to mislead the police or if it falls into the definition of a terrorism hoax,\" he said. While it is not known if the man has a criminal record, it has been reported that he is not on any international no-fly lists, and no concerns were raised when he went through airport security in Canada. \"He is not on any list [of people banned from flying] and he's been through the security check in Canada,\" a police spokesperson said, confirming that the man was a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin. A man who sat next to the suspect on the flight said he was returning to Pakistan after a very long time to get married. The suspect was apparently happy, and was a bit drunk. \"When he was arrested, he remained calm and did not react much,\" said the passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was later reported that all the passengers—excluding the suspect—were transported back to the aircraft, which was to fly to , , where the crew will be changed, and then continue to Karachi. “We were very concerned and it’s good news they were all safe,” said airline spokesperson Sultan Hasan. He added that there was no further risk to anyone aboard the flight. “The plane would not have taken off unless it was cleared by the security team,\" he said. Stockholm-Arlanda Airport released a statement stating that the incident had \"no impact on air traffic, public transport or traffic on the roads to and from the airport.\"\n",

      "|209059|Southwest Airlines to purchase AirTran Airways for US$1.4 billion\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-cost US airline announced Monday that it would buy its low-cost rival for US$1.4 billion. The merger announcement comes just days after United Airlines sealed a merger deal with Continental Airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The acquisition of AirTran represents a unique opportunity to grow Southwest Airlines' presence in key markets we don't yet serve and takes a significant step towards positioning us for future growth,\" Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest, said after the merger was announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Southwest-AirTran deal, which awaits antitrust regulatory approval, will gain Southwest a larger US network. By merging with AirTran, Southwest will also be a strong competitor in Eastern United States cities such as New York City, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, , Georgia and Washington, D.C., cities that Southwest had previously not touched much. Southwest also will be going international for the first time, inheriting AirTran's Mexican and Caribbean routes. The newly merged company would keep Southwest's name and livery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Southwest will be offering AirTran stockholders US$7.69 per share. That's 69% more than AirTran's Friday, September 24 closing price. However, AirTran stock shot up 62% to $7.36 on Monday, while Southwest's stock rose more modestly to US$14.01. Delta Air Lines stock declined by 2% on Monday, as Southwest will gain an AirTran hub at Atlanta, which is also Delta's primary hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new airline would carry over 100 million passengers, creating the world's fourth largest airline. Last year, Southwest carried 101,338,000 passengers, while AirTran carried 23,998,000 fliers. Southwest will be 25% larger after the merger is completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though some people worry that airfares will go up, as people worried about during the United-Continental merger, others, including Southwest, aren't too worried. \"America needs this now. You could go from Rochester, N.Y., to somewhere on AirTran, and from Charlotte to somewhere on AirTran. But with this deal you can now go just about anywhere in the country, and to the Caribbean and Mexico, on Southwest.. . With the more than 100 destinations that Southwest will now have, all the legacy airlines will have to set their prices based on whatever Southwest does,\" says Tom Parsons of BestFares.com. Parsons also said that \"I think America is going to very happy that now they can fly coast-to-coast between 100 U.S. cities and make the legacy airlines be more competitive with the style of Southwest and their low fees.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer advocate Clark Howard also weigned in with a positive remark on the deal. \"It's so good for the flying public. This is an opportunity for a discounter to have the kind of heft and national reach of the full-fare airlines,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Southwest even has said that fares could go down, as the \"Southwest effect\", which is supposed to stimulate competition, \"has the potential to stimulate over two million new passengers and over US$200 million in consumer savings, annually\" in Atlanta, according to the company. After the merger, Southwest also plans to drop AirTran's checked baggage fees of US$20-25. Southwest currently does not charge for checked baggage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Others aren't as thrilled with the merger of the low-cost airlines. \"This is truly a shocker, and it can only mean further consolidation. I don't think anyone really saw this coming. More than any recent merger, it spells bad news for low fares, since both airlines were leaders in the low fare space and had frequent, almost weekly, sales. I can only imagine that now pressure is on for American to find a partner, and also US Airways, and that will lead to even less fare competition.\" says George Hobica, of airfarewatchdog.com. Hobica also said that \"The era of irrational, stupid, destructive fare sales is over. This is the new normal. JetBlue now has permission to raise prices between Baltimore and Boston. Other airlines now have permission to raise prices between Washington, D.C., and Florida.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Hobica was generally pessimistic about the deal, he did state that the Southwest takeover would be a win for AirTran customers, \"because Southwest has better service than AirTran and lower fees.\" \n",
